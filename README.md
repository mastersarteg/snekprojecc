# snekprojecc

Hey Reader! This is my first project where I have dabbled into neural networks and Qlearning.

The project is a simple snake game based on pygame which I have then automated using a Qlearning model developed in pytorch.

To run, download all files and open the directory in terminal and put command 

"python agent.py"
