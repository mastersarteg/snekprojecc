# snekprojecc

Hey Reader! This is my first project where I have dabbled into neural networks and Qlearning.

The project is a simple snake game based on pygame which I have then automated using a Qlearning model developed in pytorch.

To run, you need to install the following modules <br>PyGame <br>torch <br>torchvision <br>numpy
<br>then download all files and open the directory in terminal and put command 

    python agent.py


Ps: I had a lot of help from youtube tutorials and similar online resources to create the Qlearning model and going through those resources has piqued my interest even more in this field of programming.
