# snekprojecc

Hey Reader! This is my first project where I have dabbled into Pytorch and Qlearning.

The project is a simple snake game based on pygame which I have then automated using a Qlearning model developed in pytorch.
<br> <br> To run, you need to install the following modules <br> <br>
    • pygame <br>
    • torch <br>
<br>
To install aforementioned modules run the following commands in terminal <br> _(You will need to have a relatively recent version of python already installed on your machine)_

    pip install pygame
<br>

    pip install torch torchvision

After that, Run the code by opening the terminal in the same directory as all the files and type:

    python agent.py

Ps: I had a lot of help from youtube tutorials and similar online resources to create the Qlearning model and going through those resources has piqued my interest even more in this field of programming.
