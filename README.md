# snekprojecc

Hey Reader! This is my first project where I have dabbled into neural networks and Qlearning.

The project is a simple snake game based on pygame which I have then automated using a Qlearning model developed in pytorch.

To run, you need to install the following modules,
PyGame, torch, torchvision, numpy
then download all files and open the directory in terminal and put command 

"python agent.py"
